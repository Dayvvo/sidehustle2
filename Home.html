                <h3>1. TopCoder</h3>
                
                <p>
                    TopCoder is one of the original platforms for competitive programming online. It provides a list of algorithmic challenges from the past that you can complete on your own directly online using their code editor. Their popular Single Round Matches are offered a few times per month at a specific time where you compete against others to solve challenges the fastest with the best score.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The top ranked users on TopCoder are very good competitive programmers and regularly compete in programming competitions. The top ranked user maintains his own blog titled Algorithms weekly by Petr Mitrichev where he writes about coding competitions, algorithms, math, and more.

                <h3>2. Coderbyte</h3>
                
                <p>
                    Coderbyte provides 200+ coding challenges you can solve directly online in one of 10 programming languages (check out this example). The challenges range from easy (finding the largest word in a string) to hard (print the maximum cardinality matching of a graph)                
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    They also provide a collection of algorithm tutorials, introductory videos, and interview preparation courses. Unlike HackerRank and other similar websites, you are able to view the solutions other users provide for any challenge aside from the official solutions posted by Coderbyte.

                <h3>3. Project Euler</h3>
                
                <p>
                    Project Euler provides a large collection of challenges in the domain of computer science and mathematics. The challenges typically involve writing a small program to figure out the solution to a clever mathematical formula or equation, such as finding the sum of digits of all numbers preceding each number in a series.                </p>
                
                <p>
                    You cannot directly code on the website in an editor, so you would need to write a solution on your own computer and then provide the solution on their website.                </p>
